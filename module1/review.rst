Review
==========

Once again the features that are supported for ASM ansible module:


        Policy Activation/Deactivation

        Blank Policy Creation

        XML Policy Import

        Binary Policy Import

        Policy Creation using Application-Ready Templates


The LTM and Sys modules are much more feature rich, where most configuration options are available.
